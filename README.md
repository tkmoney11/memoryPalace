## Welcome to your memory palace

### What is a memory palace?
A Memory Palace, or method of loci, is "*a strategy of memory enhancement which uses visualizations of familiar spatial environments in order to enhance the recall of information*" - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_of_loci)

### Ok, cool, but why is there a GitHub repo for it?
This project is a practice tool for your memory palace. 

### Why would I need a practice tool? 
Ever wanted to memorize the order of a deck of cards? Look no further! This website will allow you to:
1. Assign people or characters to a deck of cards
2. Practice those associations
3. Recall the order of a deck of cards using your newly created memory palace!
