## What is a memory palace?
A Memory Palace, or method of loci, is "a strategy of memory enhancement which uses visualizations of familiar spatial environments in order to enhance the recall of information" - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_of_loci)

## Ok, cool, but why is there a GitHub repo for it?
This website allows you to create a memory palace and practice with it!
